# health-data-NY

The SQL Code takes raw csv data on Health Inspections on each restaurant in the New York State and converts it into a Data Warehouse, allowing the user to access any data needed from the database. 

This code was done specifically for the Health Inspection of NY State restaurants. 

The raw csv can be found on the [Food Service Establishment: Last Inspection](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Food-Service-Establishment-Last-Inspection/cnih-y5dw) page of the NY Health Data website.
